<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, we need to figure out what secret number Alice and Bob (that's you) are going to use to communicate. We can reveal it through a series of computations. First, we need to find <span class="math-tex">\(B\)</span>. Recall from Stage 1 that this is produced by Bob picking a random natural number <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>, where <span class="math-tex">\(1 &lt; b &lt; p\)</span>, and performing the following calculation with the publicly-known <span class="math-tex">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span>:<br/>
<span class="math-tex">\[B=g^b\bmod p\]</span></p>
<p>For example, let's say <span class="math-tex">\(g = 3\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(b = 7\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(p = 23\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a relatively simple calculation to perform: <span class="math-tex">\(g^b\bmod p=3^7\bmod 23 = 2187 \bmod 23 = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In theory, this algorithm may work - a one step computation seems easy enough, right? But what if <span class="math-tex">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> both are <span class="math-tex">\(100\)</span>? Then, <span class="math-tex">\(g^b\)</span> is a number with more than two hundred digits! This won't be memory-efficient to compute and store (it might even cause an integer-overflow error, depending on the variable type you're using!).  In real cryptography, the numbers are significantly more than 100, so we're going to need a more efficient algorithm. </p>
<p>Through the mathematics of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Modular Exponentiation</a>" we can find an alternative algorithm which avoids dealing with gigantic numbers.  To perform this procedure, start off with <span class="math-tex">\(c = 1\)</span> (this is just a starter number for the calculation, which is always chosen as 1), then iteratively perform the following computation for successive values of c ("c-primes" - here, these are just used to store the result of the calculation so we can carry it forward into the next calculation):</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(c'=(c\cdot g)\bmod p\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(c''=(c'\cdot g)\bmod p\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(c'''=(c''\cdot g)\bmod p\)</span></li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>If you perform this calculation <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>-times, the c-prime you end up with is guaranteed to equal the result for <span class="math-tex">\(B\)</span> you would've got from the previous memory-intensive calculation! Now you don't have to worry about those huge numbers! (You can reference the above linked Wikipedia article for a more detailed explanation if you want)</p>
<p>If <span class="math-tex">\(g = 3\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(b = 7\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(p = 23\)</span>, then again starting off with <span class="math-tex">\(c = 1\)</span> we can work out:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((1\cdot3) \bmod23=3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((3\cdot 3) \bmod23=9\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((9\cdot3) \bmod23=4\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((4\cdot3) \bmod23=12\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((12\cdot3) \bmod23=13\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((13\cdot3) \bmod23=16\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\((16\cdot3) \bmod23=2\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>-th (7th in this case) calculation reveals that <span class="math-tex">\(B=2\)</span>, which as promised is the same as the earlier, direct method of calculating it. Notice that while this involved more steps, the numbers stayed small. This will improve our program's memory efficiency because it won't have to deal with computing and storing giant numbers.</p>
<p>Now that Bob (you) has their <span class="math-tex">\(B\)</span>, you're just lacking one number (Alice's <span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span>) to compute the shared secret. Alice will send it to you.</p>
<p>Compute the shared secret <span class="math-tex">\(S=A^b\bmod p\)</span>, then send <span class="math-tex">\(B\)</span> to Alice, so she can compute the shared secret too.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>At this stage, your program should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(g\)</span> from the input (same as in Stage 1);</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">OK</code>;</li>
<li>Compute <span class="math-tex">\(B\)</span>;</li>
<li>Take <span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span> from the input;</li>
<li>Compute the shared secret (you're going to use this in Stage 3 to encrypt messages);</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">B is [B]</code>.</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">A is [A]</code>. (this won't be kept for the next stage; it's just for validating this stage)</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">S is [S]</code>. (this won't be kept for the next stage; it's just for validating this stage)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>For the purposes of this stage, the tests are acting as "Alice" and your program responds as "Bob". The example below shows how your program should work.<br/>
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the tests' input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>a = 21, b = 15</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; g is 245 and p is 999
OK
&gt; A is 413
B is 179
A is 413
S is 512</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>a = 21, b = 15; different g and p</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; g is 28 and p is 644
OK
&gt; A is 336
B is 364
A is 336
S is 224</code></pre>
